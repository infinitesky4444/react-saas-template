# react-saas-template
Remains of a failed saas business I once tried to build. Now avaible as a template for building an saas application using React + Material-UI.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Node.js

```
sudo apt install nodejs
```

### Installing

1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/dunky11/react-saas-template
cd react-saas-template
```
2. Install dependencies
```
npm install
```
3. Start the local server
```
npm start

Your browser should now open and show the app. Otherwise open http://localhost:3000/ in your browser.
